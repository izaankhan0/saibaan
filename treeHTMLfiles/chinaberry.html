        The Chinaberry tree is an elegant, graceful tree native to the subcontinent. It is especially prolific in the northern parts of the region and is known usually as Bakain. This gorgeous tree attains a height between 25-30 feet tall in Karachi and 
<br><br>
        A relative of the Neem tree, its leaves are strikingly similar to its relative. Still, the Chinaberry can be differentiated by its distinctly blue leaves in contrast to the yellower Neem. The author in fact affectionately used to call the Chinaberry Neela Neem before learning of its proper name.     
        The Latin Suffix Azedarach comes from Persian (Azad Darakht) meaning free or noble tree. Melia refers to its leaves in that they’re similar to the Ash tree.
<br><br>
In the spring, Chinaberry trees produce lilac clusters of flowers, which while modest, are still a delightful sight. Flowers are spread at the very top of the canopy so it looks as though someone has decorated the tree with a dusting of purple sugar, like a funnel cake!
<br><br>
As with most fast growing trees, the Chinaberry’s wood is rather brittle and hence is not recommended for high wind areas. Grown trees are known to snap off with fierce winds so it is highly advisable to keep them in more protected areas.
<br><br>
Additionally, the tree can experience brief deciduous periods in Karachi, where the tree drops most of its leaves and turns rather brown. Then, its fruits – the Chinaberry – dangle from the trees like grapes.
<br><br>
Bakain and Dhrek are two forms of the same tree. Both flower in the same way and have identical leaves, and their discerning feature is their growth habit. Bakain takes upon a shrubby habit – not growing taller than 15 feet – whereas Dhrek grows into a wider, taller tree at around 30 or so feet. Dhrek trees are also comparatively leggier and their shade is not as dense as the Bakain. Dhrek trees additionally don’t have any particular shape whereas Bakain takes on an umbrella-like shape.
<br><br>
Between small specimens, they can be identified in the length of their branches. Bakain develops more twiggy growth with short limbs whereas Dhrek has longer branches.
<br><br>
Most Chinaberry trees in Karachi are in fact the Dhrek form despite them being referred to as Bakain. The true Bakain form is much more abundant in Punjab where a saying goes that the Chinaberry’s shade is so dense that even during heavy rains, the ground underneath remains dry!
