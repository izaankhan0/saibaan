        Chikoo Trees are best known for their sweet fruit which is very popular across the country. Very few people, however, are aware that this tree is not in fact native to our region, coming all the way from Central America.
<br><br>
        Chikoo is a very slow growing tree which can grow up to fifty  feet and live up to a century. This tree is extremely wind resistant and its bark has a white gum like latex known as Chicle which is sometimes used in the making of chewing gum and other products. This tree can only survive in very warm tropical or subtropical environments making Karachi a great location for its plantation. 
        <br><br>
        The much loved Chikoo fruit which is widely consumed is actually a large berry. Enjoyed for its very sweet taste, it is about 2-3 inches in diameter and has an earthy brown colour.
        <br><br>
        Chikoo is a great option if you want to plant a fruiting tree in Karachi.  The best time to plant is early monsoon and it usually tends to bear fruit three years after plantation. The fruiting season is between December and March.
