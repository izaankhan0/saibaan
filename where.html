    <h1>Where to Plant Trees</h1>

            <h2>Anywhere you can! </h2>
            <h3 class=" txt-1">Some of the trees in our list, as we will describe, form canopies whereas others take upon a more wall-like habit. </h3>
            <h4 class=" txt-1">Canopy trees, in terms of orientation, work just about everywhere. <br>Trees which take on a more wall-like habit however, are most useful when planted facing the West or South as they can block the sun and cast a shadow more effectively then.You can see this principle play out in real life</h4>

            <p class="right txt">For example, see the trees planted in the median along Khayaban-e-Badban. On main Badban and 22nd Street is a medium sized Copper Pod which casts a considerable amount of shade. Such canopies work everywhere regardless of orientation. As you go further along this street, note how wall-like trees by contrast don’t provide all that much shade on the street.
                Distance Between Trees
                <br><br>
                You should plant trees at least 10 feet apart for small trees. This would allow each tree to grow to its full potential more easily.
                <br><br> For medium trees, this can be between 15 and 20 feet and for larger trees (especially like the Banyan, Neem, Mango, and Peepal) you might like to keep 20-30 feet between each tree. These are suggestions but we really do insist on maintaining a minimum of 15 feet between trees (except for the small ones). At the end of this booklet we have included a database about the specific characteristics of each tree, including their mature size in Karachi.
