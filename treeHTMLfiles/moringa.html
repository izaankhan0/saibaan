        The Moringa tree is one that needs little introduction. This fast growing tree has made its way into Karachi’s urban fabric at a rapid pace. From health-powders to urban forestry, and combating malnutrition, Moringa’s one of the more versatile trees Karachi’s lucky to have!
<br><br>
The tree blooms twice a year: in the early summer and post-monsoon season. Its flowers are yellowish white and edible. In the dark, the white flowers seem to glow against the dark leaves like a starry night sky. Moringa’s leaves and fruits are edible as well. Moringa fruits emerge after the flowering period as long skinny green sticks. They’re best when tender so try and make sure the pod’s about as thick as the base of your thumb. 
<br><br>
Moringa is often dubbed the ‘Miracle Tree’ due to its exceptional nutritional content. The leaves are chock full of vitamins, minerals, and all sorts of antioxidants. The fruit is so rich in Vitamin C that a 100 gram serving would exceed your daily requirement!
<br><br>
The seed pods become fibrous and dry over time, eventually turning brown. These seed pods hang on the tree for months at a time, eventually softly dropping down on the ground like a projectile. The seed pods are hard on the outside but easily crack open to reveal a number of large black seeds with papery wings enclosed in a Toblerone-esque triangular pod. You can plant these seeds immediately to multiply them easily.
<br><br>
Moringa trees are perhaps Karachi’s fastest growing. Well cared for specimens can attain rapid growth, truly unlike any other tree in this list. They may also, admittedly, take on a rather unappealing shape at times. Uncared for Moringas may be shrubby, leggy, or otherwise unappealing though this is easily remedied. Luckily, they take very kindly to pruning!  Upward shaping can force the tree to heights of 30-35 feet, with a wonderfully dense canopy.
<br><br>
One thing to note is that Moringa’s wood is rather weak. So, particularly strong winds (like during the monsoon) may snap off a few Moringa branches here and there. On any other day of the year, this isn’t a cause for concern however.
<br><br>
One particularly unique quality of the Moringa is that it is very easily propagated. It is so easily propagated that one may simply stick large, sturdy trunks into soil and marvel at how quickly a tree forms from the cutting. The author himself has successfully grown multiple large cuttings in this way, one even being over 20 feet long!
